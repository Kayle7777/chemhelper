          notes: |
              Cyborg parts are classified as light, standard, sturdy or heavy. Durability increases with heavier parts, but mobility decreases. Overweight cyborgs will also use slightly more power.

              For the most part, the game will prevent you from inserting unsuitable (job-banned etc.) brains automatically. If you use an AI interface board instead of a brain, the AI will be able to assume control of the cyborg body at will.

              Remove limbs: use the wrench on the frame, then select the appropriate cyborg part.
              Remove brain: detach the cyborg head first, then click on it with the wrench.

      info:
          notes: |
              Amusing ducks will slowly move around at random, quacking and emitting a playful jingle. They will occasionally lay eggs (similar, but not identical to Easter eggs), which in turn may contain fun items.

              When emagged, they lay eggs and quack more frequently. However, they will also play their jingle on dissonant chords, giving them a distinctly 'wrong' and slightly unsettling sound. Amusing ducks can be colossally annoying when a lot of them are stacked into a small area and can easily inspire some to violence to make the quacking stop.

      info:
          notes: |
              Once you've opened the maintenance panel, pulse the wires to figure out their function and then bypass the safety by cutting the corresponding cables. They are randomized for every bot.

              Power cell = Click this with an empty hand to remove the cell for recharging or upgrading.

              You hear a radio crackle. = Leave those wires alone. Used for navigation and to interface with PDAs.

              The charge light flickers. =  Leave as is. Both wires need to be intact or the bot will be immobilized.

              The load platform clunks. =  Pointless. Out of the box, any type of cargo can be loaded onto the MULE now.

              The drive motor whines briefly. = Disables the speed limiter. Highly recommended, but make sure to only cut one of the two wires!

              The external warning lights flash briefly. = When cut, the machine will knock and run over anybody in its path. This wire has no impact as far as prone people are concerned, as the MULE never tries to avoid them.

    - name: Space pod
      unsorted: true
      info:
          notes: |
              Be advised that you have to stand adjacent to the south west corner of the pod in order to construct it, since it is a 64x64 sprite. Use a bottle of champagne on the finished pod to give it a unique name.

              To add extras, use a crowbar on the south west corner of the pod and add any system. To replace an existing system (like the engine), click the pod with an empty hand while the maintenance panel is open to bring up an interface for adding and removing installed systems. 

              You can also change the gas mix used for the engine and the gas mix used for the pod's life support system, though this doesn't have much of a use other then to suffocate the people in the pod with plasma.

          - Crowbar also opens unpowered doors with raised bolts.
      info:
          notes: |
              Door wiring is randomized per game, but all doors have the same wires. Main and backup power functions are tied to the local APC, and using a multitool to pulse wires will only work if the door has power.

              Main power = Disables main power temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut).

              Backup power = Comes online 10 seconds after main power fails. If both main and backup power are down (by APC failure or cutting both wires), the door can be pried open if the door isn't bolted, welded shut or emagged.

              Electrify = The door becomes electrified temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut), shocking anybody who tries to open or interact with it.

              ID scan = Identifiable with multitool ("access denied" animation plays). Scans the ID of people trying to bump-open a restricted door, and will deny them access when the wire is cut. All-access airlocks don't use ID scan.

              AI control = Disables control temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut). There's a lengthy-but-automatic hacking procedure that allows AIs and cyborgs to regain control provided that at least one of the power wires is still intact.

              Open/close = If ID scan is disabled or unnecessary, pulsing this wire will trigger the open/close cycle. Cutting the wire disables the motor that drives the mechanism.

              Bolts = Toggles (pulsed) or drops (cut) the bolts. A bolted airlock will remain closed or open until it is unbolted (a multitool is therefore very handy for hacking), and not even the crowbar is enough to move it. The bolts can fall if the door has no power, but they can't be retracted in that state.

              Quick & dirty method = Find a random airlock, cut every wire until the bolts drop, make a note of which color does this. Proceed to target airlock, cut every other wire except that one, then use the crowbar.

          notes: |
              Vending machines have four wires and four lights on them. The function of each wire is randomized each round, but the same for all vending machines.

              Inventory (green light) = Unlocks hidden items when pulsed (light is on). Not every vendor has unlisted inventory.

              ID check (purple/yellow light) = Disables access restrictions when cut (light turns yellow), allowing anybody to vend items. Doesn't work on machines that ask for money.

              Electrify (orange light) = Electrifies the vendor temporarily (pulsed; light is on) or permanentely (cut).

              Malfunction (red light) =  Causes the vendor to randomly launch items at nearby people when pulsed (light is blinking) or cut.

              Manufacturers have four wires and four lights on them. The function of each wire is randomized each round, but the same for all manufacturers.

              Inventory (white light) = Unlocks higher speed settings (up to 5) and hidden items when pulsed (light is on). Not every manufacturer has unlisted inventory.

              Power (red light) = Controls the power supply. Shocks the hacker when pulsed, and disables the machine when cut.

              Electrify (yellow light) = Electrifies the manufacturer temporarily (pulsed; light is on) or permanentely (cut).

              Malfunction (blue light) = When pulsed or cut (light is blinking), the machine will malfunction, working more slowly and making awful grinding noises.

          - Have the wirecutters in hand to cut or mend desired wire(s).
          - Use the screwdriver on the APC when finished.
      info:
          notes: |
              APCs have four wires, although two wires are identical. Unlike other devices, APC wires can be bitten, which acts the same as wirecutters - but remember that if you don't have the real thing, you can't mend them again. Killing the power to an APC also automatically cuts the power to doors and machinery in the area controlled by that APC, meaning you can use this as a faster means for door hacking if you don't plan on using any powered devices for a short period.

              ID lock = Unlocks the interface temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut), bypassing the need for an ID with engineering access.

              AI control = Disables control temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut).

              Power - Disrupts the APC's ability to supply electricity to the associated area temporarily (pulsed) or permanentely (cut). If you pulsed the wire by accident, cut and mend the cable to restore power instantly.
